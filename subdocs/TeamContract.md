## 5. Team Purpose

> If the members respect each other then the team would feel a sense of accomplishment, unity, and share of responsibility. Overall, if each member of the team accepts these rules then everything will run efficiently and we all will do well on the assignments. For example, if group members listen to other group member's ideas, then the group would have more ideas to work with to come up with the best solutions.

We work to get the assignment done while upholding the University Honor Code. We want to reduce stress, miscommunication, and create a productive team environment.
