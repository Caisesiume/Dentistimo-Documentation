### <center>Practices used</center>

## 1. Pair programming

Pair programming is a practice commonly used in Agile software development. In pair programming, two developers work closely together on the same code. Usually, they sit at the same computer where one is considered the driver and conducts the actual coding, while the other acts as the observer or navigator through continuous feedback and suggestions. In our case however, this is usually done remotely due to the circumstances of the current situation. On occasions, an extra observer is present during the sessions. The assigned roles are interchangeable and often swapped between the development meetings.

## 2. User stories

Because we have chosen to use Scrum as our agile framework, user stories felt like a natural addition to our project. A user story is a short description including what a user want to achieve and usually also why. In our case they are created by the team. They are based on requirements and does also include acceptance criteria, which can be found on our Trello page.


## 3. Continuous integration(CI)

In order to streamline our workflow, we have chosen to use continuous integration. CI is a practice where the developers integrate their work though version control to one and the same place, in our case the master branch. Every time code is pushed, it's tested and verified automatically in order to detect errors as soon as possible.

## 4. Iterative planning

Throughout the duration of the project, we have decided to use the Iterative Planning practice in our process. Iterative Planning may be defined as a practice where the project adapts while progressing, and may be impacted by feedback from either team members or from an outside source.
The team members are actively developing and planning throughout the duration of the project, and may voice their opinions
and concerns, which then may be discussed within the team and with relevant stakeholders. Due to the openness of the team, Iterative Planning works well, and provides opportunities for changes to be made
that each and every team member can willingly adhere to. Iterative Planning allows for quick and efficient changes to be made without unnecessary delay, and therefore reduces the risk of the project becoming standstill.

## 5. Scrum

Even though Scrum is more of a framework for agile than an actual practice, we chose to include it here since it covers many activities and practices that we use.

- Sprints  
  Also called iteration if not used in the context of Scrum, is a set of time periods, in our case 1 week, which includes planning, development and evaluation.

- Sprint planning  
  Every new sprint is initiated through a sprint planning meeting, in our case every wednesday. Here we choose items in our backlog that we feel should be worked on or finished by the end of the sprint. After this is done, we also do planning poker to estimate how much time will be needed on each backlog-item. We then compare the total to what we managed to do the previous sprint to see if the estimation is reasonable.
- Sprint review  
  Sprint reviews are also usually done on wednesdays, before the sprint planning for the upcoming sprint. Here we evaluate the result from the last sprint in regards to the product.
- Sprint retrospective  
  In our case we bundle this together with the Sprint review. Here the main goal is to evaluate in regards to the process. The main goal is to develop and enhance our way of working while focusing on the quality and efficiency of the different processes.

### <center>Management decisions</center>

- Before starting the second sprint, the team decided on changing the sprint length to one rather than two weeks as we had prior. Amongst other things, This meant that we had twice as many planning- retrospect and review sessions. We decided to due to this primarily to improve our ability to adapt to changes or unforeseen issues, while also facilitate communication.

- Another thing we decided on quite early was to not rotate roles during the project. Even though we had a product owner and a Scrum master and they had a more general responsibility related to their roles, the team was always very involved in most aspects regarding this so we didn't feel like rotating roles would benefit us much in this case.

- We decided on having both the sprint review, sprint retrospect and sprint planning on the same day each week, mainly this would make the planning for the upcoming sprint easier and this would also allow us for focusing more on development with less interruptions during the rest of the sprint.
